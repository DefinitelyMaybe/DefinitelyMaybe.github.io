			This project started taking shape really quickly. <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/"
				>Svelte.kit</a
			>
			and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwindcss</a> have been the best development choices I've ever made.
			After doing the usual configuration and deployment checks, it was time to integrate my
			old projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nowhere can anyone find better examples of how far they've come than by looking back at their own projects years later. To web developers out there,
			some of my oldies used global scripts within the <code>index.html</code>... we've come a long way. 
			The idea of mobile first and responsive image sizing would've been huge development efforts back then. Now I'm simply in shock
			by how quickly I could get those same things done with less effort.
		</p>
		<p>
			Remaking old projects was not a straight forward decision. Doing so expands the scope of the project which in turn takes more time. It's usually easier to start from stratch. When I looked into the <code>Reveal.js</code> project all I could see was
			some clever css styling for 2013. Good in it's own time but not as good as tailwindcss today. For the interested reader, I suggest watching tailwind's <a

			>. The kicker for me was that implementing the same features as <code>Reveal.js</code> is simpler with tailwind.
		</p>
		<p>
			Svelte's also very deserving of the lime light. Snappy navigation within the website is the default. Anyone on the internet these days has moved on from a
			website because it took too long to load or do something. Svelte.kit is the result of years of high requirements as well as a persmise of solving common issues that plague the well known frameworks.
			It was a no brainer for me.
		</p>
		<p>
			All in all, the remake only took me a couple of weeks including rewriting and rewording some articles. Darn good use of my time.
