		We all know innovation is important, it's the guantlet by which all new ideas must pass before
		becoming a reality. It's a pretty big barrier to entry as most people figure out - making even
		the smallest idea come to life requires a ton of investment, not just money but time, effort and
		sacrifice. It can easily feel disheartening, like its better not to try, and this is called the
		status quo.
	</p>
	<p>
		Peoples reaction to innovation can be roughly divided in two camps. Either they want it because
		it has great potential or, they're afraid of the consequences of breaking a thing that worked.
		Buffering something fagile from the outside world is a natural strategy as old as your immune
		system. Your computer is also an example. It's layers, protocols and messaging surrounding a
		fagile bit of electronics thats pretty darn easy to break.
	</p>
	<p>
		War is an analogy usually coupled with innovation but your immune system is a better one. The
		goal of your immune system is to balance your body's health - which the majority of the time is
		a constant battle between itself and the outside world. Things can go awry, like in extreme
		cases cancer and auto-immune diseases, but on the whole you'll probably live to a ripe old age.
		That is success and innovation is a integral part. Virus's and Bacteria aren't sitting back too
		disheartened by your defenses, no, you're going to get colds again and again. Survival is
		dependant upon innovation.

		Amoung the various kicker's of trying to innovate is that commincating the problem can be very
		hard wheras an adequte solution could be something your kid comes up with. It's the source of a
		good joke - depending on the day.
	</p>
	<p>
		Much like trying to innovate, communicating your next idea with others usually doesn't get you
		anywhere but is also the first worthy hurdle to overcome. other people are a multiplier
		propertional to how well you connect with each other. If you're running the guantlet, there is
		not better aid than a friend who believes in you. Secondly, a cup of tea in isolation isn't
		important. What's important is the cummulation of cup's of tea over time. For the guantlet,
		someone standing with you the whole way is worth more than a thosand people cheering you on
		during the highlights.

		the amount of investment you made in making it a thing in the first place. You want other
		people, perspectives, ideas, methods, something, anything. You need innovation. You have a
		complex question encapsulated within an environment who's details aren't making sense. For the
		rest of us, well, the work I want to do with my pay check is build the something which enables
		you to build/test/try-out your idea.
