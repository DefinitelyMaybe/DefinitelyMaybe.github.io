# notes

- nobody cares about the details of a function
- naming a function something more descriptive is called better user experience
- mobile first
  - Limit display to just the available screen space
  - display as little as possible initially and let the user navigate to:
    - a graph, image, number or output of some kind
- manage the references
- button to add basics onto the screen
- draw inspiration from physical calculators
