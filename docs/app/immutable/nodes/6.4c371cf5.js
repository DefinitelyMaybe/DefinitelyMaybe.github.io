			then dive on in.</p> <p>Right, but where to begin? Probably with Minecraft. For the uninitiated, Minecraft is a
			procedurally generated block game. Procedural means that aspects of the game are not strictly
			pre-defined. The classic example is terrain. When the player starts a game there is not a
			pre-made map designed from head to toe. Instead, an algorithm executes a series of
			instructions building up a random map layer by layer.</p> <p>The next unique thing about Minecraft is that there is no story, no narrator, no objective, no
			tutorial - nothing. Naturally this stumps a lot of people. Why would people play a game that
			has no point to it? I could try to give a reason to this but instead let&#39;s point out a fun
			fact on sales: Minecraft has sold a total of 24 million copies since it&#39;s release in 2009, 10
			million more than it&#39;s closest runner up - World of Warcraft.</p> <p>Now, onto the most notable thing about Minecraft - the blocks. How did that become a thing?
			Simply put, this is because behind the scenes terrain is explicitly coupled with grid
			coordinates. Hugely easier to implement in code but does restrict terrain aesthetics. It
			should be noted that even with the restriction, Minecraft&#39;s community has built tons on-top of
			and around the game to the point where one would call it a feature rather than anything else.</p> <h3>What&#39;s TUG like at the moment?</h3> <p>It&#39;s a sandbox like minecraft. You can explore an infinite world, craft weapons, tools and
			armour, build castles, hunt down animals and more. I&#39;m a huge fan of the subtleties that come
			with the voxels - super nice curves in terrain when digging out caves and of course the 3D
			modeled objects populating that terrain are a big plus.</p> <p>Game development is like a long roller coaster ride and Nerd Kingdom has had it&#39;s fair share
			of ups and downs. In brief, TUG was at an early stage of development. Nerd Kingdom is
			preparing to release version 2 around the end of 2016. With it will be a lessening of the
			hardware restrictions due to OpenGL, the introduction of Javascript for scripting, node.js
			integration, a new art style and much more.</p>`,k,v,j,M,w,D=`<h3>Where do I come into the story?</h3> <p>Well, I had somehow managed to bump into NK&#39;s Kickstarter campaign back in 2013. It caught my
			eye for a number of reasons among which was their simple approach to “we want to be bigger and
			better than Minecraft”. In plain, start where Minecraft should have - with the community and
			grow with them.</p> <p>I was a star grazer for at least a year. See, DirectX11 was a hardware requirement of the
			first version. I built myself a computer when I finally had the opportunity (#PoorStudent).
			After a while of playing the game normally I decided to give modding a go. I had heard of
			modders before but it had always been a black-box. Luckily for me, there were other members
			within the community for me to engage with and learn from.</p> <p>My Mods that I&#39;ve put the most work into would be Portal Stones and Dark Ages. Both mods had
			elements of 3D model manipulation, GIMP image editing, scripting and MATHS! Forgive me but I&#39;m
			the kind of person who gets super excited the intersections between maths and computer
			science. Portal Stones was all about quaternions - how to rotate objects in 3D space and Dark
			Ages was all about simplex noise - how to procedurally generate terrain.</p> <p>There is more to come for the future of TUG, namely neural networks/AI however that story is
			one that we should not speculate on. As a small teaser, here&#39;s a render of the art direction
			for TUG v2.</p>`,$,T,N,U,b,P=`If you&#39;re interest here is a link to one of the <a href="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256657525/movie480.webm?t=1447378587">original videos talking about TUG</a>

			Apparantly there was a lot of tension between @ino and another director within the company.
			@ino stepped down, communication with the commuinity was cut and nobody&#39;s heard anything
			since. The communitty deserved better than this and the game itself was heading in the right
			direction.</p>`,A,y,q,S,_,K;return{c(){s=u("h1"),s.textContent=r,c=p(),t=u("h2"),t.textContent=a,h=p(),g=u("section"),g.innerHTML=W,k=p(),v=u("img"),M=p(),w=u("section"),w.innerHTML=D,$=p(),T=u("img"),U=p(),b=u("p"),b.innerHTML=P,C=p(),x=u("hr"),H=p(),I=u("section"),I.innerHTML=E,A=p(),y=u("img"),S=p(),_=u("img"),this.h()},l(e){s=m(e,"H1",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),G(s)!=="svelte-1ydjlkg"&&(s.textContent=r),c=d(e),t=m(e,"H2",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),G(t)!=="svelte-mr6jiu"&&(t.textContent=a),h=d(e),g=m(e,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),G(g)!=="svelte-pod4g8"&&(g.innerHTML=W),k=d(e),v=m(e,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0}),M=d(e),w=m(e,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),G(w)!=="svelte-1pikztg"&&(w.innerHTML=D),$=d(e),T=m(e,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0}),U=d(e),b=m(e,"P",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),G(b)!=="svelte-eomnyy"&&(b.innerHTML=P),C=d(e),x=m(e,"HR",{class:!0}),H=d(e),I=m(e,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),G(I)!=="svelte-1sxepks"&&(I.innerHTML=E),A=d(e),y=m(e,"IMG",{class:!0,src:!0,alt:!0}),S=d(e),_=m(e,"IMG",{class:!0,src:!0,alt:!0}),this.h()},h(){l(s,"class","text-center text-2xl"),l(t,"class","text-center text-sm"),l(g,"class","py-2"),L(v.src,j="images/TUG/TUGconceptArtmini.jpg")||l(v,"src",j),l(v,"alt","TUG concept art of a golem"),l(w,"class","py-2"),L(T.src,N="images/TUG/TUGupdate.jpg")||l(T,"src",N),l(T,"alt","The feet of an TUG avatar surrounding by seedlings"),l(b,"class","py-4"),l(x,"class","py-2"),l(y,"class","py-2"),L(y.src,q="images/TUG/TUGupdatedart.jpg")||l(y,"src",q),l(y,"alt","TUG updated artwork style"),l(_,"class","py-2"),L(_.src,K="images/TUG/TUGmount.gif")||l(_,"src",K),l(_,"alt","TUG mount artwork")},m(e,o){n(e,s,o),n(e,c,o),n(e,t,o),n(e,h,o),n(e,g,o),n(e,k,o),n(e,v,o),n(e,M,o),n(e,w,o),n(e,$,o),n(e,T,o),n(e,U,o),n(e,b,o),n(e,C,o),n(e,x,o),n(e,H,o),n(e,I,o),n(e,A,o),n(e,y,o),n(e,S,o),n(e,_,o)},p:V,d(e){e&&(i(s),i(c),i(t),i(h),i(g),i(k),i(v),i(M),i(w),i($),i(T),i(U),i(b),i(C),i(x),i(H),i(I),i(A),i(y),i(S),i(_))}}}function ce(f){let s,r,c;return r=new re({props:{$$slots:{default:[le]},$$scope:{ctx:f}}}),{c(){s=p(),ee(r.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(t){te("svelte-9p4hp",document.head).forEach(i),s=d(t),ae(r.$$.fragment,t),this.h()},h(){document.title="A Story about TUG"},m(t,a){n(t,s,a),se(r,t,a),c=!0},p(t,[a]){const h={};a&1&&(h.$$scope={dirty:a,ctx:t}),r.$set(h)},i(t){c||(F(r.$$.fragment,t),c=!0)},o(t){B(r.$$.fragment,t),c=!1},d(t){t&&i(s),ie(r,t)}}}class me extends z{constructor(s){super(),R(this,s,null,ce,O,{})}}export{me as component};
